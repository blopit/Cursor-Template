# Awesome Cursor Rules Templates

## Overview
This directory contains a curated collection of specialized rule templates for different technology stacks and frameworks. These templates provide best practices, conventions, and guidelines specific to various development environments and can be adapted for specific project requirements.

## Structure
Each subdirectory contains rule templates for specific technology stacks or combinations:
- Framework-specific rules (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Language-specific guidelines (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- Full-stack templates (Next.js + TypeScript, FastAPI + React, etc.)
- Specialized configurations (AI/ML, Blockchain, etc.)

## Usage
1. Choose the appropriate template directory based on your project's tech stack
2. Copy relevant rules to your project's `.cursor/rules` directory
3. Modify the rules as needed for your specific requirements
4. Ensure proper glob patterns are set for file matching

## Template Format
Each template follows a standard structure:
```yaml
