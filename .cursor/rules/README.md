## Purpose

This template helps you:
- Organize your Cursor rules for efficient AI-assisted development
- Implement best practices for full stack applications
- Maintain consistent coding standards across frontend and backend
- Optimize AI interactions for better development velocity
- Track and improve AI usage metrics

## How to Use

1. **Customize Stack Definition**: Edit the `stack/stack-definition.mdc` file to match your project's technology stack
2. **Apply Architecture Patterns**: Use the patterns in `patterns/architecture/` to guide your application structure
3. **Follow Development Workflows**: Implement the workflows in `workflows/implementation/` for efficient development
4. **Leverage Templates**: Use the templates in `templates/` for common components and patterns
5. **Track Metrics**: Monitor AI usage and optimization in `metrics/`

## Key Benefits

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding standards across your entire stack
- **Efficiency**: Leverage AI assistance for faster development
- **Quality**: Implement best practices for architecture, performance, and security
- **Maintainability**: Create a codebase that's easy to maintain and extend
- **Optimization**: Continuously improve AI interactions for better results
