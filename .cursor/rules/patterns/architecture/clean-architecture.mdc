# Clean Architecture Patterns

This rule defines guidelines and best practices for implementing clean architecture in software projects, ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.


## Core Principles

### 1. Dependency Rule

- Dependencies should only point inward
- Inner layers should not know about outer layers
- Outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse
- Use dependency inversion to maintain this rule

### 2. Separation of Concerns

- Divide the system into distinct layers with specific responsibilities
- Each component should have a single responsibility
- Minimize coupling between components
- Maximize cohesion within components
