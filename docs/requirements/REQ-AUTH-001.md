# Requirement: User Authentication [REQ-AUTH-001]

## Description
The system shall provide a secure user authentication mechanism that allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. This functionality is essential for identifying users, protecting user data, and providing personalized experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can register with email, password, first name, and last name
2. Email must be in valid format and verified through a confirmation link
3. Password must be at least 8 characters and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character
4. Email must be unique in the system
5. Users can log in with their email and password
6. Users can request a password reset via email
7. Users can update their profile information
8. Users are automatically logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity
9. Failed login attempts are limited to 5 consecutive failures before temporary account lockout

## Test Scenarios
1. Test successful registration with valid data
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-001
   - File: `tests/auth/registration.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that a user can successfully register with valid email, password, and name

2. Test validation for invalid email format
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-002
   - File: `tests/auth/validation.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that registration fails with appropriate error message when email format is invalid

3. Test validation for password complexity
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-003
   - File: `tests/auth/validation.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that registration fails when password doesn't meet complexity requirements

4. Test validation for duplicate email
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-004
   - File: `tests/auth/validation.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that registration fails when email is already registered

5. Test successful login with valid credentials
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-005
   - File: `tests/auth/login.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that a user can successfully log in with correct email and password

6. Test login failure with invalid credentials
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-006
   - File: `tests/auth/login.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that login fails with appropriate error message when credentials are incorrect

7. Test password reset functionality
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-007
   - File: `tests/auth/password-reset.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that a user can request and complete a password reset

8. Test profile update functionality
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-008
   - File: `tests/auth/profile.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that a user can update their profile information

9. Test session timeout after inactivity
   - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-009
   - File: `tests/auth/session.test.js`
   - Description: Verify that a user is automatically logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity

10. Test account lockout after failed login attempts
    - Test ID: TEST-REQ-001-010
    - File: `tests/auth/security.test.js`
    - Description: Verify that an account is temporarily locked after 5 consecutive failed login attempts

## Dependencies
- REQ-DB-001: Database Schema
- REQ-SEC-001: Security Requirements
- REQ-EMAIL-001: Email Service

## Security Considerations
- Passwords must be stored using strong, industry-standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt)
- All authentication-related communications must be encrypted using HTTPS
- Authentication tokens must be securely generated and validated
- Protection against common attacks (e.g., brute force, CSRF, XSS) must be implemented

## Performance Requirements
- Login and registration operations should complete within 2 seconds under normal load
- The system should support at least 100 concurrent authentication operations

## Status
Approved
